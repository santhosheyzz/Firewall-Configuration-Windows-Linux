# üîê Firewall Configuration on Windows & Linux

Welcome to the **Firewall Configuration Project** where I demonstrate how to use firewall tools in **Linux (UFW)** and **Windows Defender Firewall** to control network traffic with basic rules such as blocking or allowing specific ports.

---

## üéØ Objective

- Configure a firewall on both Linux and Windows
- Block and allow specific ports (e.g., block Telnet port 23, allow SSH port 22)
- Test the applied firewall rules
- Understand how a firewall filters traffic
